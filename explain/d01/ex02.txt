#If you run find with exec, {} expands to the filename of each file or directory found with find (so that ls in your example gets every found filename as an argument - note that it calls ls or whatever other command you specify once for each file found).

Semicolon ; ends the command executed by exec. It needs to be escaped with \ so that the shell you run find inside does not treat it as its own special character, but rather passes it to find.
Using ; (semicolon) or + (plus sign) is mandatory in order to terminate the shell commands invoked by -exec/execdir.

The difference between ; (semicolon) or + (plus sign) is how the arguments are passed into find's -exec/-execdir parameter.
